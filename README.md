        <p class="Paragraph"> I have always been an Accountant, I wanted to become an Accountant since i was 12. I went through school knowing that i would become an excellent accountant. I graduated from UNI with good grades and certification and a good job fell on my laps. The reality was so much different, it didn't feel like what i would enjoy forever anymore. I wanted a way out but what is it? I have focused on only being a good Accountant that i dont know how i would begin to learn to excel in another field. i felt stuck. <br> I wanted more</p>
